# Harmony:

	A iptables wrapper to make creating rules easier

	Supports uid/gid matching, arp tables

	Aimed for very restrictive systems, only allows what you need

	Easy to use config file

	Scriptable

# TODO:
	Test for non router setup
	Allow updating dns with -s/-d
	cron jobs
	add/remove rules on the fly
